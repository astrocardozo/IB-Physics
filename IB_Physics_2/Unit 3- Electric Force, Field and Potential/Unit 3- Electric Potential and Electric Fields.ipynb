    "When a free positive charge  $q$  is the presence of an electric field, the electrostatic force will arise and cause it to accelerate. As is accelerates, it is given kinetic energy. The process is analogous to an object being accelerated by a gravitational field. It is as if the charge is going down an electrical hill where its electric potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Let us explore the work done on a charge  $q$  by the electric field in this process. In the code below, we have set up two parallel charged plates set to a potential difference of $500 V$. We have set a charge particles inital `velocity` to be $0 m/s$ and will graph the `Kinetic Energy` as a function of `Time`. Run the cell below to see what happends to a charged particle in the presence of a uniform electric field."
