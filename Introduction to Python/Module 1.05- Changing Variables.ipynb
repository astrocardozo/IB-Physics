This is where we need to note that the ``=`` in Python is not an equals sign like you see in a math class; it's an **assignment operator**, in that it tells Python to compute the math on the right and **assign** that value to the variable ``a``. **It doesn't matter if ``a`` is used on both sides**, since Python can just overwrite the previous value of ``a``. Think of this as like saving a new version of a document: You don't need the old version anymore, so your computer uses the same filename to save the new version.\n","\n","Run the next set of code cells to see another example of variable reassignment."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9-FFpIwYXV-4"},"source":["%precision 3 \n","# Take the number we want to work with and store it\n","# under the name a.\n","a = 4\n","\n","output = a\n","output"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["output = output * a\n","output"],"metadata":{"id":"0scs-EOuRTBr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["output = output * a\n","output"],"metadata":{"id":"LrSC8cyDRUZh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["output = output * a\n","output"],"metadata":{"id":"pMBAYureRVm7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2QUYXZk9XV-4"},"source":["## Checkpoint\n","How do the code cells above change the value of ``output``?
