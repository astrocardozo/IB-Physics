    "\n",
    "To import a library, we use the `import` command, usually formatted as `from library import abbreviation`, where `library` is the name of the library you want and `abbreviation` is a shorthand we use for that library name. While you can name `abbreviation` anything you want, most libraries have a preferred `abbreviation` to help make it easier for programmers to read each other's code.\n",
