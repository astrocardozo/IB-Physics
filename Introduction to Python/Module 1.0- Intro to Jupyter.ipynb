These mistakes might be physics errors (such as entering the wrong formula) or simply typing errors that cause the code to fail. This is okay. No one writes an essay perfectly the first time, and no one writes a code perfectly the first time. Fortunately, Python tries to help us find these mistakes through **error messages**.\n","\n","Think of an error message as feedback. The message is meant to show you approximately where the error is located in the code and what Python was trying to do when the error occured. Sometimes Python's error messages will tell you exactly what you need to fix; other times, you'll have to dig around. But either way, the goal is to help make your code better.\n","\n","For example, while preparing this tutorial, I received the following error message:\n","\n","\n","`` print( 1 + 1/1 * 1/2 * 1 * (2-1) - 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1 * (2-1)*(2-1)``\n","\n","``SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing``\n","\n","Python printed a line of code for me to tell me that this was the line it was trying to carry out when the error occured. Then Python gave me a message, written in a bit of computer-ese. ``EOF`` here means \"end of file,\" which Python found to be ``unexpected``. In other words, **I'm missing something.** If I look carefully over the line of code that Python printed, **I see that I'm missing a ``)`` to close out the print command.** This happens to me all the time! It just means I was distracted and thought I was done with this line of code when I really needed one more thing. So, I added the ``)`` character and the code ran fine!\n","\n","You will learn to interpret error messages and fix errors through experience. There isn't really a formal way for us to **teach** this process to you other than to provide feedback when an error message arises. So, when you recieve an error message, try the following:\n","\n","1. Read the message and try to extract whatever meaning you can. Look at the name of the error, and any feedback that Python is providing you.\n","2. Go to the line referenced by the error message and see if there's something you missed. This is like proofreading a written document; pretend like you're reading it for the first time, and if something doesn't make sense, it might be a problem! You might need to look in the line before or the line after the line that Python referenced. (By the way, to see your line numbers in Jupyter notebook, click on the View menu, and then Toggle Line Numbers.)\n","3. Save a backup of your code, and try to fix the error. You can't possibly make it any worse!\n","4. If that doesn't work, try googling the error message. **You are not the first person this has happened to** and the answer is probably documented somewhere on-line.\n","5.
