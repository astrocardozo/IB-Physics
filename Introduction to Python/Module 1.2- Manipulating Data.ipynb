Add code to the code cell above to carry out each of the following. You can add new lines to the code cell with the Enter key, just like in a document.\n","\n","1. Calculate the **kinetic energy** of the cart ($K = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$). You can square the velocity data by using `database['velocity']**2`. Note that `**` is Python's way of raising a number to a power. You'll also need the mutiplication operator `*` and the division operator `/`. Store these kinetic energy values in a new array called `database['kinetic energy']`. Make a graph of kinetic energy versus time.\n","2. Calculate the **height** of the cart by multiplying the displacement array times the sine of the ramp angle. (You can access the sine function using `np.sin(angle)`, with `angle` replaced by the ramp angle in radians.  Store these kinetic energy values in a new array called `database['height']`. Make a graph of the height versus time.\n","3. Calculate the **potential energy** of the cart ($U = mgh$). Store these potential energy values in a new array called `database['potential energy']`. Make a graph of the potential energy versus time.\n","4.  Now calculate and graph the total energy. What do you notice about the total energy when comparing it to the kinetic and potential energy?\n","5. You could accomplish all of these tasks in a spreadsheet. In what ways do you think it is easier to carry out these tasks in Python? In what ways do you find it more challenging?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["[Add your answers here]"],"metadata":{"id":"jastOcFTZt69"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LCVWP8iQKzc8"},"source":["# References\n","\n","This notebook is based on Brian Lane's [LetsCodePhysics tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsCodePhysics/featured) and Adam LaMee's [CODINGinK12 tutorials](https://adamlamee.github.io/CODINGinK12/)"]}]}
