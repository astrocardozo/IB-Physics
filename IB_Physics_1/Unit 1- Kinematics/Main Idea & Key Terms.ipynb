    "# Main Idea\n",
    "\n",
    " Unit 1 sets the foundation for kinematics firmly within the framework of objects and systems. It introduces the definitions of basic variables that describe motion. Vectors are introduced to describe motion in a single dimension.  This will build a foundation for understanding vector components necessary in more general motion. Linear motion is described in in general, but most topics and problems address motion with constant acceleration. Graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time are constructed and analyzed. Unit 1 will expand this discussion beyond the single dimension. \n",
