This last step assumed that we had a nice, clean mathematical expression we could compare with the data. But that isn't always the case.\n","\n","For example, if we wanted to fit trajectory data from a projectile motion experiment, we could use the standard expressions $x(t) = x_0 + v_{0x} t$ and $y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2$. But if our experimental data showed significant influence from air resistance, we wouldn't have such a nice mathematical expression. Instead, we would **build a computational model**.\n","\n","Building a computational model involves \"using a computer to create an abstract representation of\n","a physical system or phenomenon\" ([Weller et al, 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07981.pdf)). Creating such a representation involves translating physics into code, planning and constructing an algorithm, applying conditional logic based on events within the model, and adapting or extending previous approaches to new contexts ([Weller et al, 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07981.pdf)). We would like to **introduce** this process to students in a scaffolded manner, starting with constant-velocity one-dimensional motion.\n","\n","# Translating Physics into Code\n","\n","We start by **translating** the definition of velocity $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ into code. This translation requires **rearranging** this equation into $\\Delta x = v \\Delta t$. Although these expressions are mathematically equivalent, they have very different uses. The traditional $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ is useful in lab: It assumes we know the position $x$ at multiple values of $t$ and we want to figure out what the velocity $v$ was. On the other hand, $\\Delta x = v \\Delta t$ enables us to predict what will happen to the position $x$ if we know the velocity $v$ over a time interval $\\Delta t$. This type of prediction allows us to represent motion in our computational model. You've learned how to translate this equation into code: `v * dt`. (`d` is easier to type out than `delta`.)\n","\n","You've probably invoked a slope when you describe $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ to your students. What related graphical quantity could you use to describe the rearranged $\\Delta x = v \\Delta t$?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":26,"status":"ok","timestamp":1643736588943,"user":{"displayName":"W.

We want to predict the position at **multiple** times $t$, which will involve three steps:\n","\n","1. Calculate the displacement $\\Delta x$.\n","2. Update the value of $x$ by adding $\\Delta x$ to the previous value. This step is a rearrangement of $\\Delta x = x_f - x_i$ into $x_f = x_i + \\Delta x$.\n","3. Repeat as necessary.\n","\n","We make a slight change to the last equation in Step 2 when translating into code: Since we *don't need* the previous value of $x$ anymore, we can just overwrite it using `x = x + dx`. **This expression throws most students off**, since it wouldn't make sense mathematically to write $x = x + \\Delta x$. However, we use this confusion to emphasize how the computer reads `x = x + dx` as \"add `x` and `dx` together **and then** save that new number as `x`.\" This is the process of **overwriting** the value of `x`.\n","\n","Now we only need a way for the computer to \"repeat as necessary.\" For this reptition, we use a **while loop**, which is a type of conditional logic. \n","\n","# Applying Conditional Logic\n","\n","A while loop is set up in Python as follows:\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","while some condition :\n","  code to carry out repeatedly\n","\n","code to carry out after the loop finishes\n","```\n","\n","The `some condition` is a logical test that Python can evaluate as True or False. As long as `some condition` is True, Python will keep repeating the loop. For example, if we want to keep repeating our `x = x + dx` until `x` reaches a value of 7, we would write `while x < 7 :`. (You can use `<` for \"less than\" or `<=` for \"less than or equal to\" depending on whether you want the loop to run one more time when `x` reaches 7; this difference rarely matters for our purposes.) \n","\n","The colon `:` after `some condition` is necessary for Python to know we're signalling something special in the next line. The `code to carry out repeatedly` is indentend from the left side so that Python knows this is part of the loop. **Anything indented after the `:` is part of the loop and will be repeated**. On the other hand, `code to carry out after the loop finishes` is **not indented**; it's outside the loop, and Python will carry it out only after it finishes the loop.\n","\n","1. Think back to your graphical interpretation of $\\Delta x = v \\Delta t$. If we're now repeating this process many times over small step $\\Delta t$, what calculus operation are we (secretly) carrying out?
